## ACT I: Generating images from quotes in [Sixty Six](https://sixtysix.frontendweekly.tokyo/)

I've been publishing weekly roundup of frontend related news and articles for about 6 or 7 years.

It's safe to say I like reading and I've started to highlight when I read. (I use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) for reading on Web and Kindle for books. I've been switching between Pocket and Instapaper)

I used to give talks on meetups and conferences and all the talks I've given (about 40 talks), I always ended with a quote.

> Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote. He says someone else has already said it best. So if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong.
> â€” Danny Vinyard. American History X, (1998)

I've followed this advice and quotes are not just in the end. Moreover, If quotes are in English which are almost always, I translate them into Japanese. I needed to have a system not to redo my translation therefore I made a collection of quotes.

I want to create a new home for highlights from my newly found habit and old quotes I've collected.

That's why I've started [Sixty Six](https://sixtysix.frontendweekly.tokyo/). (What's with the name? It comes from quote symbol which looks like 66.)

Sixty Six has been very useful for me since I still quote when I write in Virga.

Then I remembered I've tried to implement generating social media preview images, but I thought it's not all that worth to put efforts into implementing, generating and storing images just for social media.

While I need to figure out how to tackle accessibility obstacles using images which primary content is text, I could use good-looking quotes.

There are many excellent tutorials on this topic already:

- [Generate Social Media Preview Images](https://www.d-hagemeier.com/en/articles/en/articles/generate-social-media-preview-images/)
- [Automated Social Sharing Images with Puppeteer, 11ty, and Netlify](https://dev.to/5t3ph/automated-social-sharing-images-with-puppeteer-11ty-and-netlify-22ln)
- [Headless chrome netlify functions](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-functions-headless-chrome)

All right, let's give it another shot.

And this is where my journey begins.
This is a story about implementing auto-generate Images from article data with Eleventy and Puppeteer.

### Inciting Incident:

Although I haven't thought about how I want this image would look like, I've given a thought about what I need to do to make this happen.

1. Create a template HTML
2. Prepare data for the template HTML to generate final HTML
3. Take a snapshot of generated HTML

Eleventy is a static site generator, so it's very good at doing 1) and 2).
For 3), I'll be using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/) for taking a snapshot.

## ACT II: Eleventy is very good at templating

For 1) and 2), [Generate Social Media Preview Images](https://www.d-hagemeier.com/en/articles/en/articles/generate-social-media-preview-images/) by Dennis Hagemeier is quite helpful.

Eleventy has this [pagination](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/) feature and despite its name, I can use this to iterate over a data set and create pages for individual chunks of data.

I already have a "data set" which is my quote which is my main content for article in Sixty Six.

Each of my article has this in its front matter:

```yaml
---
date: '2014-02-13'
quote: |-
  You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
tags:
  - Steve Jobs
when: '2005, Jun 12'
cite: Stanford Commencement Address.
---

```

I already have whole quote which comes in very handy for this story.

As for "create pages", it can be done by "just" creating a template. It is rarely justified to say "just" in this kind of story but with Eleventy, I think it's OK to say "just" here.

I did follow Dennis Hagemeier's tutorial with a few modifications.

```yaml
---
pagination:
  data: collections.posts
  size: 1
  alias: preview
permalink: {% raw %}"/previews/{{ preview.data.page.fileSlug }}/index.html"{% endraw %}
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true
---
```

I want to name generated HTMLs same as my article's and that is what {% raw %}`permalink: "/previews/{{ preview.data.page.fileSlug }}/`{% endraw %} is doing. I did need help of `console.log()` for figuring out to come up with {% raw %}`{{ preview.data.page.fileSlug }}`{% endraw %}. It turned out [official document has this documented](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#collection-item-data-structure).

And here it is, after an hour or so, I've come up with the design:

![Preview I've ended up with](/images/2020-05-09-ow3H5TJq@2x.png 'Final design for preview')

Now I need to take screenshots.

## Midpoint: Taking screenshots

Puppeteer does all the heavy work for me. From [its README](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/), Puppeteer works like this:

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png'});

  await browser.close();
})();
```

Now I need to figure out how to provide URLs of all the generated HTML and file name for `{path: 'PATH/FILE-NAME.png'}`.

Tutorials I've mentioned earlier have done this via JSON file which is generated by Eleventy, and I've been following this path along as well.

Again, from Dennis Hagemeier's tutorial:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "import-tweets-from-twitter-api-in-11ty-en-preview",
    "path": "https://www.d-hagemeier.com/assets/preview-images/import-tweets-from-twitter-api-in-11ty-en-preview.html"
  }
]
```

It does look simple, and I can imagine how this would be used in Puppeteer for taking screenshots.

Then I took another look at [Stephanie Eckles's article](https://dev.to/5t3ph/automated-social-sharing-images-with-puppeteer-11ty-and-netlify-22ln). Her approach is a bit different from Dennis Hagemeier's.

She has a template which will be feed into Puppeteer as plain HTML, then she used generated JSON file(which is done by Eleventy) to manipulate that HTML. Puppeteer has `page.setContent()` method which can consume strings of HTML to `setContent` on `page`.

Then I thought, could I combine these approaches together?

Eleventy allows me to use [JavaScript as one of the template language](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/javascript/) which means I can use Puppeteer in it and I'm sure I can use Pagination feature which provides data I need to generate HTMLs.

At this point, I already have created HTMLs using Pagination feature, but I need to port that to JavaScript Template Language(Let's call this `.11ty.js` from here on).

I could've created a boilerplate HTML like Stephanie Eckles's solution, but I decided to do all the HTML generation in `.11ty.js` since my entire HTML is about 50 lines or so.

It was turned out to be a bad decision.
I'm sure I'm missing something but...:

- ðŸ—» There is no `include` in `.11ty.js` - â†ª I have loaded it via `fs.readFileSync()`
- ðŸ”Ž Couldn't find a way to use filters - â†ª Only filter I need was mine, so I imported it as a normal modules and use it as a normal function
- ðŸ˜¢ I needed to do lots of `console.log()` to see where the data I need - â†ª I should've done TDD using Jest, so I could have used `toMatchSnapshot()`.

### Metatags to display them as social media preview images

Despite my bad decision, I have made it work so let's use them to display on social media. I always consult [HEAD by Josh Buchea](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) whenever I need to add metatags in `<head>` and it does indeed have [Social](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD#social) section.

I wanted to add `socialImage` field to each posts data, but couldn't get it work as expected so:

```html
{% raw %}<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="{{ site.url }}/previews/{{ page.fileSlug }}/preview.png"
/>{% endraw %}
```

I did this instead which works fine, I think.
...And it works:

## Finale

Generating screenshots takes a lot of time, so I only do it when `process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV === 'production';`. I haven't pushed it to GitHub, so I don't know what will happen on Netlify build yet.

I'm thinking about using [Netlify Build Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/build/plugins-beta/). According to Phil Hawksworth, [it can access to the cache between build](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth/status/1257284661874692097) which sounds like a godsend to my situation.

Exploring Netlify Build Plugins will be a great story.

Finally, Netlify build is done: `Build time: 3m 17s. Total deploy time: 3m 27s` and last time I had deployed Sixty Six, it was `Build time: 1m 18s. Total deploy time: 1m 30s`.
For now, I can live with it but I won't be porting this feature to any other blogs right now.

Well, then until next journey.
