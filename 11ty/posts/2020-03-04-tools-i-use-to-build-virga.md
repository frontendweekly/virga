## Hardware: MacBook

First off, I'm Apple guy so tools I'll Introduce here are heavily leaning to that direction.

My current is MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017).
I don't own an external keyboard nor monitor.

## Editor: IntellJ IDEA & iA Writer

I used be a Vimmer but I've been using [IntellJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for 4 or 5 years now for coding.
And I use iA [Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for any other writing which is where Virga's inspiration comes from by the way.
I love iA Writer. I've been using it since it's released.

I've been looking for very light weight editor for coding. IntellJ IDEA is too heavy for small changes.
[Xi editor](https://xi-editor.io/) looks very promising so I'm looking forward its progress.

## Terminal: iTerm2

iTerm2 is my choice for a termial app. I've tried Hyper for while but I went back to iTerm2.
My default shell is now [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/) which I've made the switch after I upgrade to Catalina.

I have so many command line tools with me so I'm not gonna share them all here but I'll list ones I use in developing websites.

[`direnv`](https://direnv.net/)
: Load/unload environment variables based on \$PWD

[`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
: Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor

[`lynx`](https://lynx.browser.org/)
: Text-based web browser

[`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
: Clone of cat(1) with syntax highlighting and Git integration

[`z`](https://github.com/rupa/z)
: Tracks most-used directories to make cd smarter

[`gh`](https://cli.github.com/)
: GitHub CLI

[`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
: Fast and simple Node.js version manager

[`tidy-html5`](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5)
: Granddaddy of HTML tools, with support for modern standards

[`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
: Search tool like grep and The Silver Searcher

[`imageoptim-cli`](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI)
: Automates ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, and JPEGmini for Mac to make
batch optimisation of images part of your automated build process

[`npm-check-updates`](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates)
: Find newer versions of dependencies than what your package.json or bower.json allows

## Other apps

I don't do UI design but when I need to do some vector related stuff, I use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/).

I like color. So I have [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) and [Spectrum](http://www.eigenlogik.com/spectrum/mac). The former is a color picker app though I love its color contrast ability for it. The latter is a color scheme design app.

My default browser is [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).  
I've made the switch from Chrome from this year and I only go back to Chrome when I need to do some serious performance audit.

## Web Tools

[ColorBox by Lyft Design](https://www.colorbox.io/)
: Color scheme for Virga is come from this tool

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com)
: Flowcharts„ÄÅwireframes, sticky notes and mind maps tool. I use this almost everyday

There are other tools I use at work regularly but for building Virga, I use those 2 tools.
