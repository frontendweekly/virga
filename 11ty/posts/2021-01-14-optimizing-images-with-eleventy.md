> ‚Äî Jeff Atwood, ["Performance is a Feature"](https://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature/)

This statement from Jeff Atwood had gotten me into the **#perfmatters** initiative which was started by many Googlers. I still love faster web.

Often, JavaScript gets blame on this performance, and I do think it is the one of the biggest hurdle.
I don't have any client side JavaScript working on Virga, so what's next on the list for the change of the slowness?

Images.

I don't have those too many on Virga, but I sometime do. And I haven't done anything to images for performance optimization.

`<img>` element is a veteran of HTML. It's been in HTML since I had started to write HTML, but it has gone through many changes. 
It had introduced `srcset` attribute and image format like `png`, `webp` and the latest one `avif`. Moreover, `<img>` even has a new sibling `<picture>`.

What a journey it must've been.

And this is where my journey begins.
This is a story about implementing performance optimization for images using Eleventy and GitHub Actions.

## The mighty `<picture>` element

Some may think `<div>` has special power, and it is only element you'd use from HTML.
Those who resonated with that sentence, meet `<picture>`.

Now that `webp` and the more recently `avif` support on the way, it may not be performant enough using `jpeg`, `png` and `gif` anymore.

How would I use those newish image formats while keeping backward compatibility?
I'm pretty sure JavaScript can do it, but why would I need to have JavaScript to do it, when I can do it using HTML?

```html
<picture>
  <!-- load avif if supported -->
  <source srcset="this-image-is.avif" type="image/avif">
  <!-- load webp if supported -->
  <source srcset="this-image-is.webp" type="image/webp">
  <!-- fallback for `source` and use attributes for presentation -->
  <img src="this-image-is.jpg" alt="You'd better not omit alt">
</picture>
```

When it compares with `<div>` or `<span>`, `<picture>` looks complicated, but above snippet isn't a complete "picture".

Well, `<picture>` doesn't do much, actually. The true power resides with `srcset` and `sizes`.

The above snippet demonstrates the power of `srcset`, let's look at what `sizes` has in its sleeve.

```html
<img srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w,
             elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
            800px"
     src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
     alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">
```

This snippet comes from ["Responsive images" at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

`sizes` looks complicated and even though MDN says it's not that complicated, it is.

`(max-width: 600px)` part is called a media condition and "describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying 'when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less'.", according to MDN.

`480px` which is right after a *space* is "The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true."

And I guess that `800px`, one that never mentioned and right after a comma, is the width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is FALSE.

`sizes` attribute determines which size of images should be used with in the viewport.

Let's invert this, so it should make it a bit more understandable‚Ä¶

When we don't want to use over-sized images for a small screen, use `sizes` to choose the appropriate image size. 

So that means, I need to use `sizes` for every image formats.

Let's combine both of snippets to unveil the true power.

```html
<picture>
  <!-- load avif if supported -->
  <source srcset="elva-fairy-480w.avif 480w,
                  elva-fairy-800w.avif 800w"
          sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
                 800px" 
          type="image/avif">
  <!-- load webp if supported -->
  <source srcset="elva-fairy-480w.webp 480w,
                  elva-fairy-800w.webp 800w"
          sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
                 800px" 
          type="image/webp">
  <!-- fallback for `source` and use attributes for presentation -->
	<img srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w,
	             elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
	     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
	            800px"
	     src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
	     alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">
</picture>
```

This is powerful but surely a big chunk of codes.
Let's not write this by hand.

***

I love markdown syntax for its simplicity.

```markdown
![Elva dressed as a fairy](elva-fairy.jpg)
```

Let's turn this into the monstrously huge chunk of `<picture>`.

## Using `@11ty/eleventy-img` with Eleventy Transforms

[`@11ty/eleventy-img`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11ty/eleventy-img) is a plugin for Eleventy which uses the [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) image processor and outputs multiple sizes, save multiple formats, cache remote images locally.

Examples at [Eleventy Doc](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) shows using it with Shortcodes, but I only use images in one layout and want to keep using markdown syntax, I'll use the plugin at [Transforms](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#transforms).

`@11ty/eleventy-img` is a simple yet very powerful plugin.
After about an hour of trial and error, I've settled with this: 

```javascript
const metadata = await Image(imagePath, {
	widths: [1500, 750],
	formats: ['avif', 'webp', 'png'],
	urlPath: '/images/',
	outputDir: './11ty/images/generated',
});
```

`metadata` will yield:

```json
{
  avif: [
    {
      format: 'avif',
      width: 750,
      height: 1168,
      filename: 'ce28e207-750.avif',
      outputPath: '11ty/images/generated/ce28e207-750.avif',
      url: '/images/ce28e207-750.avif',
      sourceType: 'image/avif',
      srcset: '/images/ce28e207-750.avif 750w',
      size: 23321
    }
  ],
  webp: [
    {
      format: 'webp',
      width: 750,
      height: 1168,
      filename: 'ce28e207-750.webp',
      outputPath: '11ty/images/generated/ce28e207-750.webp',
      url: '/images/ce28e207-750.webp',
      sourceType: 'image/webp',
      srcset: '/images/ce28e207-750.webp 750w',
      size: 37634
    }
  ],
  png: [
    {
      format: 'png',
      width: 750,
      height: 1168,
      filename: 'ce28e207-750.png',
      outputPath: '11ty/images/generated/ce28e207-750.png',
      url: '/images/ce28e207-750.png',
      sourceType: 'image/png',
      srcset: '/images/ce28e207-750.png 750w',
      size: 175924
    }
  ]
}
```

By looking at this output from the plugin, I can see what I'd need to construct `<picture>` and its siblings.
Since I've already had an Eleventy Transform for enhancing an article, I'm going to use it.

Transforms can modify a template‚Äôs output. I'd like to think of it as a post processing tool in Eleventy.
So for an article, a markdown file is used to build an HTML file, Transforms will take that output(the HTML file) and modify it.

By using this, I can "transform" this:

```markdown
![Site flow for Virga](elva-fairy.jpg)
```

into

```html
<picture>
    <source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/ddf2e4b9-558.avif 558w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px">
    <source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/ddf2e4b9-558.webp 558w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px">
    <source type="image/png" srcset="/images/ddf2e4b9-558.png 558w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px">
    <img src="/images/ddf2e4b9-558.png" alt="Site flow for Virga" title="This is a site flow for Varga" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="558" height="678">
</picture>
```

If I needed more granular control how the final HTML turns out to be, I should use Shortcodes.

Now that I'm satisfied with my initial attempt for this Transform, I'll move it to [MOLLE](https://github.com/frontendweekly/molle) for finalizing it.

## Automatic optimization for images by GitHub Action

I can always compress images at local using trusty ImageAlpha and ImageOptim. Or [Squoosh CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli) which can "optimize" webp.

If I have an image on every article, then I would remember doing the optimization on local, but I don't. So let's automate it using [calibreapp/image-actions](https://calibreapp.com/).

I have previously worked with GitHub Action. Let's say I did not have a good time back then.
Long story short, it is pretty difficult to test the action. For example, when I trigger GitHub Action by a pull request or push to the repository, I have to do it.
My last attempt was scheduling deploy, so it was particularly difficult.

And there is always smart folk on Internet, [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) can "[r]un your GitHub Actions locally üöÄ".
This tool seems like a godsend for me.

After installing Act via Homebrew, I run `act -g` which draws workflows:

```shell
act -g
‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
‚îÇ calibreapp/image-actions                  ‚îÇ
‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
```

Oh, for the workflow, I did copy and paste from [README](https://github.com/calibreapp/image-actions/blob/main/README.md#combined-workflow).

So I think it looks good so far, then I run `act -n` which is dry run.

```shell
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions] üöÄ  Start image=node:12.6-buster-slim
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   üê≥  docker run image=node:12.6-buster-slim entrypoint=["/usr/bin/tail" "-f" "/dev/null"] cmd=[]
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions] ‚≠ê  Run Checkout Branch
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   ‚úÖ  Success - Checkout Branch
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions] ‚≠ê  Run Compress Images
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   ‚òÅ  git clone 'https://github.com/calibreapp/image-actions' # ref=main
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   üê≥  docker run image=ghcr.io/calibreapp/image-actions/image-actions:main entrypoint=[] cmd=[]
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   ‚úÖ  Success - Compress Images
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions] ‚≠ê  Run Create Pull Request
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   ‚òÅ  git clone 'https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request' # ref=v3
*DRYRUN* [Compress images/calibreapp/image-actions]   ‚úÖ  Success - Create Pull Request
```

If I run `act`, it defaults to do `push` event, so I guess this is dry-running `push`.

`act pull_request -n` would mean run `pull_request` in dry-run mode.

I've got nothing. `act pull_request` gave me nothing as well.

```yaml
# Only run on main repo on and PRs that match the main repo.
if: |
  github.repository == 'frontendweekly/virga' &&
  (github.event_name != 'pull_request' ||
   github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository)
```

This was the culprit, more specifically `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository` line was the cause.

Remove entire `if`, then did `act pull_request -n`. It looks good.

Act is intended to work as a local task runner so, if I run it without `-n` it should actually compress images, but since I want to see, what actually happens when real `push` or `pull_request` have triggered.

![GitHub's pull request screen capture displaying GitHub Action result](images/2021-01-18-n80ugn4M@2x.png 'It worked üéâ')

Well, then until next journey.
