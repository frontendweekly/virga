I regrettably forgot who actually said this: "Performance optimization is not an event, it's process." This always stuck in my mind when it comes to perf.

When it comes to processes, it's important to monitor. Seeing the change reminds us.

There are lots of ways to do this, but I like light weight solution of [Speedlify](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/) which is created by Zach Leatherman.

And he explains how to use it at "[I added Lighthouse Scores to my Site’s Footer and You Can Too](https://www.zachleat.com/web/lighthouse-in-footer/)"

I did follow his instruction and it went as smoothly as expected.
I now have Lighthouse scores on my footer.

One thing I derailed from his instruction is that I didn't use his web components. I went with server-side way.
I borrowed a bit of code from his web components.

I spend some time on CSS. This is the second most complicated style in Virga, next to typography(which I'm thinking about simplify).
I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep this style, but I like how it looks. I don't like the code…

Well, then until next journey.
